# ArcGis + Python UDP Experiment with Unity

## How to run
1. Generate an API key from https://developers.arcgis.com/unity/
2. Open the project with Unity 2021 and install the ArcGis SDK using the Unity package manager. (https://developers.arcgis.com/unity/install-and-set-up/)
3. For the moment the API key is not centralized as a constant. So, paste the API key in to the serialized variable "API key" in "arcGis map" component in each "ArcGISMap" object in each map (New York, Montreal & San Fransisco)
4. Play the Unity scene, "Main Menu"

In this project, I'm following a task where I have to generate 3D cities with arcGis.

## Day 1
- Installed unity 2021 fresh, added the prerequists. (HDRP, arcGIS plugins)
- Tried to build a script to auto generate the cities by
giving lats and longs, but it took so much time and it failed. Then I moved to making three different scenes to hold the maps.
- Sucecsfully added sanfrisco, montreal and New york by looking into this https://tiles.arcgis.com/tiles/z2tnIkrLQ2BRzr6P/arcgis/rest/services/
- Added the main menu
